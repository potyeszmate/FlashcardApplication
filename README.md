# CAS trial work
## _Flashcard application_


## Features

- Inquiry: First choose a cetegory. Cards are shown in a 10 card view, card flip: only once, and the other parir is shown, Correct/Incorrect guess counter
- Study: First choose a category. Cards are shown in a stacked style with phrase pairs (can be cycled through infinitely)
- Admin view: All the CRUD functions are available here (Create, Updtate, List, Delete)
- Login and register (with google account as well)
- Other features: Authguard, dynamic title, profile page (didn't have time to complete)

## Bugs / Incompleted task

- Incompleted task: In the inquiry page, when we are done with the first 10 cards, load the remaining
- Bugs: User can reach CRUD page by typeing in the page name to the URL, Delete: you can click the delete button if you select "No" (but of course it will not delete the item, it's just clickable)
