## _Flashcard application_

A basic Flashcard application, created in Angular. For authentication and storage I used Firebase.

## Features

- Inquiry: First choose a cetegory. Cards are shown in a 10 card view, card flip: only once, and the other parir is shown, Correct/Incorrect guess counter
- Study: First choose a category. Cards are shown in a stacked style with phrase pairs (can be cycled through infinitely)
- Admin view: All the CRUD functions are available here (Create, Updtate, List, Delete)
- Login and register (with google account as well)
- Other features: Authguard, dynamic title, profile page (didn't have time to complete)
- Task left: A simple guard for admin page
